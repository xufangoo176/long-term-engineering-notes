# Engineering Notes

This repository records my long-term engineering notes.

Topics include:
- System design and domain modeling
- ToB SaaS and multi-tenant architecture
- Transaction, pricing, and asset modeling
- Reusable backend patterns and utilities (Java)

Most articles are written in Chinese, with brief English summaries.

This is a long-term personal knowledge base, not a tutorial collection.
