# Engineering Notes

This repository records my long-term engineering notes and practical experience.

I work across:
- Backend system design (Java, transaction, SaaS)
- Frontend development and integration
- Database modeling and data consistency
- Practical AI application integration in real systems

Topics in this repository include:
- System design and domain modeling
- ToB SaaS architecture and multi-tenant systems
- Transaction, pricing, and asset modeling
- Reusable engineering patterns and utilities
- Applying AI capabilities to existing software systems

Most articles are written in Chinese, with brief English summaries when appropriate.

This repository is a long-term personal knowledge base, not a tutorial collection or demo code.
